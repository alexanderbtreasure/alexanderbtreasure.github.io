            My vision to pursue a career shift into tech policy continued at the University of Toronto. While I have been enjoying my international learning experience, I recognized the issues present in limiting my scope to Western schools of thought. I gratefully have had the opportunity to join the Asian Institue as a student in the Collaborative Master's Specialization program, to hopefully give an Eastern perspective to my developing tech policy skills. Though my year is just starting, I am thoroughly appreciating my time here at the Munk School.

            As a person who had largely worked in the private sector to-date, finding a research-oriented position was quite difficult, even though many skills from software engineering translate well to research. Knowing that I would want to pursue a PhD in the future, I recognized that I required far more research experience. This position has been a tremendous opportunity to merge my expertise in data gathering with my newly acquired skills in quantitative policy research. My work to-date has been in critical data gathering via Python scripts accessing an API.

          <p>
            Over the pandemic, I curated a vision. I knew that while I enjoyed software engineering, it wasn't my only long-term goal. Certainly, I understood that I at least wanted to feel as if I was making a more meaningful impact. I took a relatively significant risk and jumped at a surprising opportunity: a Double Degree MPA/MGA program hosted by the London School of Economics in partnership with the University of Toronto. Though still distant, I saw that I would want my efforts to be materialized into me becoming a sort of policy practitioner either in the public or academic sectors, focusing on tech and innovation policy. In actuality, even with an offer letter in hand, it was quite difficult to uproot everything and move continents. Planning out visa deadlines, finding someone for a lease takeover alongside booking accommodation for the year (without getting to see it in-person in advance) and reorganizing my finances all in just over a month's time was a stressful experience, but I managed to do it all.

            My stint at LSE allowed me to reforge my existing skills and knowledge, broadening the scope of how I think about and work with data. I am grateful for the time I spent and the people I met while attending, and am glad to have this year of quantitative analysis and policy evaluation skills in my toolkit. The faculty that I learned under were some of the brightest, most passionate, and most inspirational people I have had the pleasure to meet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of the numerous opportunities at LSE that I seized the chance at, the one that I want to highlight first is my tenure as Departmental Teaching Committee representative for the School of Public Policy. My job was to liaison with students about program concerns and to attend planning meetings with faculty to address both those concerns and any course changes. Through this process, with a fellow student representative I jointly submitted a proposal for review concerning mental health and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) training. We viewed this as important due to the relative insularity of the School, where faculty and staff alike were largely unaware or simply underequipped for how to deal with students' concerns. Among faculty, our proposal proved popular (as all were interested in more transparent access to existing central resources); while our proposal ended up not being enacted as-written, the School made significant changes to mental health accessibility and DEI training. This proved to be a good thing though, as the changes that were approved were both more numerous and more substantial than the original proposal.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a team of two other postgraduate students, I participated in the annual Global Public Policy Network (GPPN) competition. While the work that we did on the project was not selected to proceed, I recognized that I had spread myself too thin and redoubled my efforts on other projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also completed a certificate program for Professional Skills in Public Policy, and was a Podcast Editor for the Public Sphere Journal Podcast. For the podcast, I interviewed Eric Protzer from the Harvard Growth Lab concerning his book titled "Reclaiming Populism."

          <p>
            My time at Asurion was my first experience living and working in a big city, and I fell in love with the lifestyle immediately. Coming from a small town, I had not previously been exposed to many of the experiences that I now felt that I could utilize to grow my potential. I was initially brought on and taught the entire tech stack and was allowed to evaluate which tasks best suited my skillset and profile. A position opened up in the operations division of my team, and there I found and cultivated a new interest in data research and concerns around digital privacy. My responsibilities included:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Architecting and building an automation framework designed to save on-call teammates time and energy, and decrease error rates when working in production.</li>
            <li>Leading the operations team in establishing runbooks and orchestrating communication between external and internal clients.</li>
            <li>Contributing to building a reliable team as a certified interviewer, helping recruiters and hiring managers make informed hiring decisions.</li>
            <li>Fulfilling client commitments, working with such technologies as Oracle, Spark, Scala, Node.JS, AWS Glue, and AWS Lambda.</li>
            <li>Realizing execution of company-wide security policies for our AWS Cloud infrastructure.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I was involved in several extra-role activities, including annual Halloween party organization, choreographed dancing for Diwali, and even taking my team to 2nd place in our regional foosball tournament in 2021. Additionally and most notably in 2021, I was the content editor and presentation designer for my team in the 2021 Asurion Sterling Regional Hackathon, in which we won 2nd place for our new business proposal — an ML-based solution for multi-platform data monitoring. Even though it was a small project, I was proud of the work that we did since that was our team's first official look into ML solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            While working at Asurion, I became AWS Certified at the <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/9ca00a6a-52ea-4f6e-9fa5-f503c673eb0d" className="content-link"><strong>Cloud Practitioner</strong></a> level. Further, I found myself wanting to know the basics of first aid should the need arise in public, and became accredited by the American Red Cross in <a href="https://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/qrcode?certnumber=00T9BRS" className="content-link"><strong>Adult, Child and Baby First Aid/CPR/AED</strong></a>. I knew that if the opportunity arose, that I would want to be capable of helping people who needed it. I plan to continue recertification to stay on top of latest best practices.

            Looking for a fresh experience in life, I found myself wanting to branch out and try a slightly different track than what I was currently on. Working for a different company in a different sector with a different job title seemed to be a promising start. I had two major accomplishments in my work with BSI:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>I corrected a long-standing database issue causing massive query slowdowns, improving web page response time by over 99% for our largest client (~7 minutes down to ~3 seconds). This resolved the biggest hang-up in the signing of a multi-million dollar contract from this client.</li>
            <li>The bulk of my time was spent on a new exception handler. It was designed as a counterpart to a decades-old process whose algorithms needed a facelift, and would consistently output hundreds of exceptions in a day. These exceptions resulted in lost data points, a definite problem for client trust in our data and the overall health of our system. In four months' work of what development time I could find, I managed to automatically resolve 95% of the issues with the exceptions with a heuristics algorithm.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In my time at BSI, I worked well above and beyond my initial station, quickly being promoted to a higher role. I am proud of the work I performed there, but I felt as though my potential went untapped.

          <p>
            Precision Telecom was my first job coming out of a university setting, and it was a bit of an adjustment for me. I had not envisioned working for a small company fresh out of undergrad, and computer science as a degree does not quite prepare you perfectly for a job in software engineering. While it was difficult to get started, I quickly felt as though I was being appropriately mentored in an environment that was conducive to learning the basics of operating in a software organization. Some of what I worked on in my time there:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Maintaining the back-end billing system, which processed tens of millions of call data records in a given month</li>
            <li>Designing front-end web pages to support clients' taxing needs through a RESTful API</li>
            <li>Constructing and redesigning the commissioning process from scratch, overhauling the system to both support larger and more varied clients and to facilitate the processing of more records in a shorter time frame</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Overall, my work at Precision operated as a safe learning environment, but I knew that I wanted something different out of life. While certainly not what I initially expected, it was a productive and useful start to my future career.

          <p>
            After graduating from Allegany, I knew that I needed a Bachelor's at a minimum if I wanted to pursue software engineering, and Frostburg was the default option. For a "default" option, FSU ended up being a place where I was able to forge long-lasting relationships with faculty, staff, and fellow students. It was the first place where I felt like I was becoming the person that I am today. While certainly a humble university, I cannot deny the life lessons that I learned while studying. My prior ways of thinking were appropriately challenged, and I came out the other side better for it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked in two capacities during my time at Frostburg, both starting around the same time. Firstly, I worked as a computer science teacher with the RSMC program (itself a division of the Upward Bound program), teaching high school students some basic ideas about computer science. Beyond the overall daily planning, my responsibilities included:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Helping students learn the basics of computing and programming, demonstrating how to utilize Visual Basic, Scratch, and LEGO® Mindstorms®, and finally helping the students brainstorm their own projects and prepare presentations on their work</li>
            <li>Proofreading the students' work to help them meet state-mandated writing guidelines</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Secondly, I worked as a software engineer with a grant team composed of Frostburg students formed by the University of Maryland as part of the Maryland Industrial Partnerships (MIPS) program. Our role was to implement a vacation planner and itinerary builder for a vacation property rental company called Silicon Travel. My role in that team was dedicated to learning the ins-and-outs of administrating a testing server, as well as cleaning and maintaining development data so that work could continue.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was involved in several extracurricular programs, including being part of the local chapters of both Upsilon Pi Epsilon and Kappa Mu Epsilon, honors societies in computer science and mathematics, respectively. I was additionally recruited by the faculty lead of the Cyber Security Club to assist in activity planning due to my familiarity with related topics.

            I graduated high school at 15, and was initially a bit lost as to what path I wanted to take in life. Ultimately, the choice came down to what I wanted to actively pursue at the moment, since I had (and still have) a genuine interest in nearly every subject. For my young age, this was a daunting task, but I landed on computer science and haven't looked back.
          </p>
          <p>
            To afford to stay in classes, I cooked and washed dishes at a local restaurant part-time. I took this first degree rather slowly then, pacing myself and letting my budget adjust. Through this experience, I learned how to juggle work and studies and how to prepare myself for adulthood.
